import React from "react";

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ fontFamily: "Arial, sans-serif", padding: "20px", textAlign: "center" }}>
      <h1>Problem 3: Simple React Web Page</h1>
      
      <h3>How the Page Was Built</h3>
      <p> Firstly I went into my text editior(VSCODE) and installed Node.js which allows me to access the npm commands.
        Next I used the command npx create-react-app cps530lab10 which set up the structure of the react app. Then finally I open 
        the folder I created and edit the App.js file to change the frontend to include the 
        content I wanted. 
      </p>

      <h3>Difficulties Encountered</h3>
      <p> Since I have created a react app before there wasn't to many difficulties creating it.
        It was pretty simple installing everything and adding the content needed. I did have difficulties 
        trying the find a way to make this accessible for everyone especially for the TA to be able to mark. 
        The solution to this was I did my own research and found out I can do this thorugh github. Finding out 
        how exactly I can host it I was able to find the correct commands and push it onto my github.
